Code Object Manager (Comgr)
===========================

The Comgr library provides APIs for compiling and inspecting AMDGPU code
objects. The API is documented in the [header file](include/amd_comgr.h).

Build the Code Object Manager
-----------------------------

Comgr depends on LLVM, yaml-cpp, and optionally depends on
[AMDDeviceLibs](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-Device-Libs). The
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` must include either the build directory or install prefix
of both of these components.

Comgr depends on Clang and LLD, which should be built as a part of the LLVM
distribution used. The LLVM, Clang, and LLD used must be from the amd-common
branches of their respective repositories on the [RadeonOpenCompute
Github](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute) organisation.

An example command-line to build Comgr on Linux is:

    $ cd ~/llvm/
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=dist \
        -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="AMDGPU;X86" ..
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ # build AMDDeviceLibs
    $ cd ~/support/lib/comgr
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="~/llvm/build/dist;path/to/device-libs" ..
    $ make
    $ make test

The equivalent on Windows will use another build tool, such as msbuild or
Visual Studio:

    $ cd "%HOMEPATH%\llvm"
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=dist \
        -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="AMDGPU;X86" ..
    $ msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
    $ msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj
    $ rem build AMDDeviceLibs
    $ cd "%HOMEPATH%\support\lib\comgr"
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="%HOMEPATH%\llvm\build\dist;path\to\device-libs" ..
    $ msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
    $ msbuild RUN_TESTS.vcxproj

Optionally,
[AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer)
may be enabled during development via `-DENABLE_ASAN=On` during the `cmake`
step.

Depend on the Code Object Manager
---------------------------------

Comgr exports a CMake package named `amd_comgr` for both the build and install
tree. This package defines a library target named `amd_comgr`. To depend on
this in your CMake project, use `find_package`:

    find_package(amd_comgr REQUIRED CONFIG)
    ...
    target_link_libraries(your_target amd_comgr)

If Comgr is not installed to a standard CMake search directory, the path to the
build or install tree can be supplied to CMake via `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`:

    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path/to/comgr/build/or/install

Debug the Code Object Manager
-----------------------------

Comgr supports some environment variables to aid in debugging. These include:

* `AMD_COMGR_SAVE_TEMPS`: If this is set, and is not "0", Comgr does not delete
  temporary files generated during compilation. These files do not appear in
  the current working directory, but are instead left in a platform-specific
  temporary directory (`/tmp` on Linux and `C:\Temp` or the path found in the
  `TEMP` environment variable on Windows).
* `AMD_COMGR_REDIRECT_LOGS`: If this is not set, or is set to "0", logs are
  returned to the caller as normal. If this is set to "stdout"/"-" or "stderr",
  logs are instead redirected to the standard output or error stream,
  respectively. If this is set to any other value, it is interpreted as a
  filename which logs should be appended to.
* `AMD_COMGR_EMIT_VERBOSE_LOGS`: If this is set, and is not "0", logs will
  include additional Comgr-specific informational messages.

Versioning
----------

Comgr is versioned according to a `major.minor` number scheme. The version of
the library can be determined dynamically via the `amd_comgr_get_version`
function. The version is not changed due to bug-fixes. The minor version number
is incremented for each backwards-compatible change introduced. The major
version number is incremented, and the minor version is reset to zero, for each
backwards-incompatible change introduced.

* `1.3`: Introduce `amd_comgr_action_info_set_option_list`,
  `amd_comgr_action_info_get_option_list_count`, and
  `amd_comgr_action_info_get_option_list_item` to replace the old option APIs
  `amd_comgr_action_info_set_options` and `amd_comgr_action_info_get_options`.
  The old APIs do not support arguments with embedded delimiters, and are
  replaced with an array-oriented API. The old APIs are deprecated and will be
  removed in a future version of the library.
* `1.2`: Introduce `amd_comgr_disassemble_instruction` and associated APIS.
* `1.1`: First versioned release. Versions before this have no guaranteed
  compatibility.

Coding Standards
----------------

Wherever possible, Comgr adheres to the same coding standards as
[LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html). Comgr also includes
configuration files for
[clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) and
[clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/), which should be used to
ensure patches conform where reasonable.

One notable exception is the `test/` subdirectory which prefers `camelBack` for
identifiers rather than `CamelCase`.
